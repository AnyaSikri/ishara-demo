## 📊 Analysis Results (Neffy Data)

### Input Data
- **Weeks analyzed:** 50
- **Date range:** 2024-09-06 to 2025-08-15
- **Script count range:** 3 to 12,185
- **Holiday weeks detected:** 4

### Drug Classification
- **Stage:** Emerging/Expanding (26-103 weeks)
- **Baseline window:** 8 weeks (Z-Score)
- **WoW thresholds:** ±10% (slight), ±25% (meaningful)
- **Z-Score thresholds:** ±1σ (slight), ±2σ (meaningful)

### Method Comparison

**WoW Method Results:**
- Baseline Building: 1
- In-Line: 18
- Slightly Above: 13
- Meaningfully Above: 13
- Slightly Below: 1
- Meaningfully Below: 4

**Z-Score Method Results:**
- Baseline Building: 3
- In-Line: 7
- Slightly Above: 22
- Meaningfully Above: 17
- Slightly Below: 1
- Meaningfully Below: 0

**Agreement Analysis:**
- **Weeks agreeing:** 13/50 (26%)
- **Weeks disagreeing:** 37/50 (74%)
- **Most common disagreement:** WoW "In-Line" vs Z-Score "Slightly Above" (16 times)

## 🔍 Key Insights

### 1. Method Characteristics

**WoW Method:**
- ✅ Simple, intuitive (% change from last week)
- ✅ Reactive to immediate changes
- ❌ Volatile, affected by single-week anomalies
- ❌ No context beyond previous week

**Z-Score Method:**
- ✅ Statistically robust (8-week baseline)
- ✅ Filters noise and identifies true trends
- ✅ Holiday-aware (excludes holidays from baseline)
- ❌ More complex to explain
- ❌ Requires sufficient historical data

### 2. Why They Disagree

**Pattern Analysis:**
- WoW often says "In-Line" when week-to-week change is <10%
- Z-Score says "Slightly Above" when comparing to 8-week average shows growth trend
- Example: Week 49 had only +4.9% WoW but +1.71σ vs baseline

### 3. Holiday Impact

**Week 13 (Thanksgiving):**
- Scripts: 1,409
- WoW: "Meaningfully Below" (-38.4%) ← Sees big drop
- Z-Score: "In-Line" (+0.54σ) ← Excludes Thanksgiving from baseline

**Week 17 (Christmas):**
- Scripts: 2,205
- WoW: "Meaningfully Above" (+64.2%) ← Sees big spike
- Z-Score: "Slightly Above" (+1.66σ) ← Excludes Christmas from baseline

## 📈 Visualization Features

### 4-Panel Interactive Chart

**Panel 1 (Top-Left): WoW Script Trend**
- Line/scatter plot of weekly scripts
- Color-coded by WoW classification
- Red diamond markers for holidays

**Panel 2 (Top-Right): Z-Score Script Trend**
- Line/scatter plot of weekly scripts
- Color-coded by Z-Score classification
- Red diamond markers for holidays

**Panel 3 (Bottom-Left): WoW Timeline**
- Horizontal timeline view
- Square markers showing classification over time
- Vertical red dashed lines for holidays

**Panel 4 (Bottom-Right): Z-Score Timeline**
- Horizontal timeline view
- Square markers showing classification over time
- Vertical red dashed lines for holidays

### Interactive Features
- Hover tooltips with detailed metrics
- Legend with all classification types
- Zoom/pan capabilities
- Export to PNG/HTML

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```python
from scripts import main

# Run complete analysis
fig, wow, zscore, diffs = main()

# Display chart
fig.show()
```

### Advanced Usage
```python
# Access specific results
print(f"Z-Score baseline for week 10: {zscore.iloc[9]['baseline_mean']:.0f}")
print(f"Holidays excluded: {zscore.iloc[9]['holidays_excluded']}")

# Export disagreements
diffs.to_csv("disagreements.csv")

# Filter for holiday weeks only
holiday_weeks = wow[wow['is_holiday_week'] == True]
```

## 🎨 Color Scheme

| Classification | Color | Hex Code |
|---------------|-------|----------|
| Meaningfully Below | Red | #FF4444 |
| Slightly Below | Orange | #F18F01 |
| In-Line | Blue | #2E86AB |
| Slightly Above | Purple | #A23B72 |

## 💡 Recommendations

### When to Use WoW Method
- Quick, real-time monitoring
- Week-to-week tactical decisions
- When simplicity is needed
- Short-term alerts

### When to Use Z-Score Method
- Strategic trend analysis
- Long-term planning
- Holiday-heavy periods
- When filtering noise is critical
- Comparative analysis across drugs

### Best Practice
**Use both methods together!** 
- WoW for immediate awareness
- Z-Score for confirming true trends
- Investigate when they disagree

## 📝 Next Steps / Enhancements

Potential future additions:
1. Add more holidays (regional/international)
2. Configurable baseline windows per analysis
3. Automated alert generation
4. Multi-drug comparison capability
5. Export to PowerPoint/Excel
6. Email reporting automation
7. API endpoint for web dashboard
